# How to upload a photo onto a README.md file
- Create a new file in your GitHub repo and choose the option upload a file.
- While you are uploading a file create and images folder.
  - You can do either on your local computer 
  or on GitHub when you create a new file and are asked to name it just type "images/" in front of the name.
  - If you can't do this, create a new throwaway .txt file and create the folder with it, then move the image 
  into the folder and delete the .txt file.
- Insert your image into README.md with the following code
  > ![](Location of file)
  
  > So in this case, write the following in the paranthesis: images/FILENAME.png
- if you need to use a space in the FILENAME use %20

# Example:

![](images/amy.png)
